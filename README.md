Predicting Loan Repayment Outcomes During GFC (Global Financial Crisis). 
Risk Modeling with Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

Welcome to the new “Data Wrangling” lesson, dear R users!

In this project, we work with the Lending Club Loan Dataset, extracted from Kaggle.

Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company based in the United States, connecting individuals who want to invest money with those looking to borrow. The Lending Club dataset contains loan data for loans issued across the U.S. between 2007 and 2015.

This large dataset, named “loans.csv”, offers real-world financial data on borrower profiles and their repayment outcomes. 
It contains approximately 2.26 million observations and 145 variables, covering loan details, borrower characteristics, account histories, and repayment statuses.

For this project, we focus on a specific subset of the dataset, narrowing in on the years of the Global Financial Crisis (2007, 2008, 2009). 
I extracted this subset directly on Kaggle, because working with the full dataset can overwhelm a standard CPU due to its enormous size. My smaller dataset, named “loans_gfc”, spans from 2007 to 2009 and contains 8,277 observations and 145 columns.

Please, check out the whole project using the attached files.
